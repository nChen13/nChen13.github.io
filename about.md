Hey, I'm Nathan.

I blog about startup operations and write short stories.[^1]

I’m the first hire and Operations Generalist at [Free Agency](https://www.freeagency.com/), building out the future of startup and tech careers. Previously, I facilitated workshops, reporting, and more for the portfolio at [ConsenSys Labs](https://labs.consensys.net/).

When it comes to blogging, I'm a fan of Tom Critchlow's philosophy of [small b blogging](https://tomcritchlow.com/2018/02/23/small-b-blogging/).

> Small b blogging is learning to write and think _with_ the network. Small b blogging is writing content designed for small deliberate audiences and showing it to them. Small b blogging is deliberately chasing interesting ideas over pageviews and scale. An attempt at genuine connection vs the gloss and polish and mass market of most “content marketing”.
