Hey, I'm Nathan.

I blog about startup operations and write short stories.[^1]

I’m the first hire and Operations Generalist at [Free Agency](https://www.freeagency.com/), building out the future of startup and tech careers. Previously, I facilitated workshops, reporting, and more for the portfolio at [ConsenSys Labs](https://labs.consensys.net/).

When it comes to blogging, I'm a fan of doing it the "small b" way. 

<blockquote class="quoteback" darkmode="" data-title="Small%20b%20blogging" data-author="@tomcritchlow" cite="https://tomcritchlow.com/2018/02/23/small-b-blogging/"> Small b blogging is learning to write and think <em>with</em> the network. Small b blogging is writing content designed for small deliberate audiences and showing it to them. Small b blogging is deliberately chasing interesting ideas over pageviews and scale. An attempt at genuine connection vs the gloss and polish and mass market of most “content marketing”. <footer>@tomcritchlow <cite><a href="https://tomcritchlow.com/2018/02/23/small-b-blogging/">https://tomcritchlow.com/2018/02/23/small-b-blogging/</a></cite></footer></blockquote><script note="" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Blogger-Peer-Review/quotebacks@1/quoteback.js"></script>
